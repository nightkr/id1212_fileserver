* Organization

- common contains common interface definitions
- server contains the server
- client contains the client

* Running

To start the client, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./sbt client/run
#+END_SRC

For some example commands, run "help".

To start the server, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./sbt server/run
#+END_SRC

You can also have the server automatically restart on code changes, by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./sbt "~; scalafmt; server/reStart"
#+END_SRC

Explanation:

- ~ runs the following commands every time a file changes
- scalafmt reformats the code to follow the project style
- reStart (re)starts the server in a background process

** Windows

If you're on Windows, install SBT from [[https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html]], and run sbt instead of ./sbt.
